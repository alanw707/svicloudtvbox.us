# Porto Agency One-Page Inspiration

Captured UI patterns from https://www.portotheme.com/wordpress/porto/agency-one-page/ to use as creative reference for SVICLOUD redesign.

## Hero (Screenshot 1)
- Dark charcoal background with floating device imagery on right; hero copy left-aligned in white with accented handwritten highlight.
- Eyebrow text in all caps thin weight, main heading heavy white with accent word in script/blue underline.
- Primary CTA: pill button with gradient blue, secondary arrow icon; secondary nav anchored along bottom of hero.
- Vertical action rail on right (Buy Now, Prebuilts, Studios, Hire Us) with icon buttons.

## About / Metrics (Screenshot 2)
- Split section: left copy block on white, right circular stacked imagery overlapping section boundary.
- Typography: blue eyebrow, bold black heading, body text grey, accent CTA link with arrow underline.
- Full-width gradient stats band below: strong blue gradient with white line-icons + numeric counters and captions.

## Services (Screenshot 3)
- Two-column layout: left column vertical list of services with icon + heading + paragraph; right column stacked device mockups.
- Tabs under header nav highlight active section using blue underline.
- consistent generous whitespace and subtle blue accent lines.

## Portfolio Grid (Screenshot 4)
- Masonry/standard grid of square tiles; hover appears to reveal text overlay (see tinted blue tile) with CTA label.
- Minimal color palette: grayscale imagery with electric blue accent tile for emphasis.
- Header retains dark top bar with white text and blue active item.

Use these patterns to inform future sections (e.g., hero motion, stats banner, services layout, portfolio/product grid interactions).
